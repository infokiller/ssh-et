# ssh-et

A simple bash script to use SSH via an
[EternalTerminal](https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal) (ET) tunnel. You
get the robustness of ET with all SSH features like
[X11 forwarding](https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal/issues/291).

This script should be a drop-in replacement for OpenSSH's `ssh` command (as long
as the remote runs an ET server).
